This is simplistic scrum planning poker application.
It keeps all data in memory, and expire it after period of inactivity.

Currently, consists of `backend` part (golang) and `frontend` part (vuejs).

== build
=== backend
`go build ./cmd/web`

=== frontend
```
yarn install
yarn run serve #run local dev build
yarn run build #production build
```
Local dev build will try to access backend on `http://127.0.0.1:10080/api`.

For production build don't forget to update `.env.production` file's variables `VUE_APP_BACKEND_URL` and `VUE_APP_BASE_URL`.
